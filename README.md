# Data Expl0rat!on

Data taken from anywhere to answer series of questions based on the dataset. As we generate raw data every secs, it is better if we can look at small percentage of data to convert into info. These info can help us understand our surroundings better. Most of the data will be historical(happened in the past). Maybe I can predict future 

Main Purpose for these workbooks are to find and understand: 
- **What dose the Data Say**
- **Did I learn something new about the data or the world**
